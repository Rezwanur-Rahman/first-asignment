            <p>
                The term world community is used primarily in political and humanitarian contexts to describe an
                international aggregate of nation states of widely varying types. In most connotations, the term is used
                to convey meanings attached to consensus or inclusion of all people in all lands and their governments.

                A mobile application, most commonly referred to as an app, is a type of application software designed to
                run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. Mobile applications frequently serve to
                provide users with similar services to those accessed on PCs. Apps are generally small, individual
                software units with limited function.
